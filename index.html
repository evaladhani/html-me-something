        Hi there. My name is Eva Ladhani. I'm married, I have a 100lb german shepherd who thinks he's a lap dog, and I'm obsessed with learning new things (more on that later). This webpage is actually an homage to all of the things I enjoy doing in my freetime. 
        
        Ever since I can remember, I've loved making things... if I can touch it or see its progress, then I'm invested. This includes everything from learning how to use WordPress to becoming a professional photographer, and all sorts of things in between.

            Back when I was in high school, I had a friend who taught herself how to use the Google website builder. Even though the work produced was consistent with a late 1990s website, it was something I didn't know how to do. That's when I decided to learn.
            So I started playing with the Google website builder but I didn't like the work it was producing. That's when I learned about WordPress. Ever since, I've been obsessed. Today, my most recent website build is my personal portfolio. You can visit it <a href="http://evaladhani.com/">here.</a>

            There's just something different about capturing a candid moment, the kind of image you're not racing to put on your facebook, something that's not completely glamorous, but boy when you look at it, it brings all of the emotions of that day back. That's what photography is to me. It's art, it's full of emotion - some images make the butterflies in your belly start up while others bring back a laughter you can't contain.

            Who read's poetry in this day and age, right? It's me. I do. I love the works of old Sufi poets. My favorite Sufi poet is Jalal al-Din Rumi, also known as Rumi.
            While his work has become more commercialized in recent years, his poetry dates back to the 13th century. Many believe that his words are so intoxicating that they're about a true love story.
            In fact, that's not the case at all. His words are about his deep relationship with God. I can't say that I can always relate and I am spiritually intune with my faith. I'm not. Not in the least bit. And yet,
            his words still bring me joy.
